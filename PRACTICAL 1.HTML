            <font color="green">
            <p><p align="justify"> An HTML tag is known as a paired tag when the tag consists of an openging tag and a closing tag as its
                companion tag. An HTML paired tag starts with an opening tag: the tag name enclosed inide the angle brackets;for example,a paraagraph opening tag is written as ---- The content follows the opening 
                tag,which ends with an ending tag:the tag name starting with a forward slash;for example,an ending paragraph tag is written as ---- The first tag can be reffered to 
                as the 'Opening Tag',and the second tag can be called Closing Tag. </p></font>
<h3><font color ="blue">Unpaired Tags</font></h3> <font color="green">
<p><p align="justify">An HTML tag is called an unpaired tag when the tag only has an opening tag and does not have a closing tag or a companion tag.
 The Unpaired HTML tag does not require a closing tag; an opening tag is sufficient in this type. Unpaired tags are sometimes 
 also named as Standalone Tags or Singular Tags since they do not require a companion tag.</p>

<h2><font color ="blue">2 - Self-Closing Tags</font></h2> <font color="green">
<p><p align="justify">Self-Closing Tags are those HTML tags that do not have a partner tag, 
where the first tag is the only necessary tag that is valid for the formatting.
 The main and important information is contained within the element as its attribute.
  An image tag is a classic example of a self-closing tag. Let’s see it in action below:

<h2><font color ="blue">3 - Utility-Based Tags</font></h2> <font color="green">
<p><p align="justify">The HTML tags can be widely differentiated on the basis of their utility,
 that is, on the basis of the purpose they serve. We can divide them basically into three
  categories as discussed below:</p></font>

<h3><font color ="blue">Formatting Tags</font></h3> <font color="green">
<p><p align="justify"><b>The HTML tags that help us in the formatting of the texts like the size of the text, font styles,
 making a text bold, etc. This is done using tags like &lt;font&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;u&gt; etc. Tables, divisions,
and span tags are also those tags that help format a web page or document and set the layout of the page. 
Below is a small program using divisions for formatting the page along with some other formatting tags.</b> 
 </p></font>
<h3><font color ="blue">Structure Tags </font></h3> <font color="green">
<p><p align="justify">The HTML tags that help in structuring the HTML document are called Structure Tags.
 Description, head, html, title, body, etc., form the group of the page structure tags.
  The structure tags only assist in creating or forming the basic html page from the root; that is,
   they do not affect or has any hand in the formatting of texts. So a basic HTML program is the basic 
   group of structural tags:</p></font>

<h3><font color ="blue">Control Tags</font></h3> <font color="green">
<p><p align="justify"> Another category of tags that can be created is ‘Control Tags’.
 The Script tags, radio buttons or checkboxes, the Form tags, etc., forms the control tags.
  These are the tags that are used in managing content or managing scripts or libraries that are external.
   All the form tags, drop-down lists, input text boxes, etc., are used in interacting with the
    visitor or the user.</p><font></font>
